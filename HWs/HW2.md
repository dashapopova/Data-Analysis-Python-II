| points        | task           | 
| :-------------: |:-------------| 
|  2     | create a database (you can create it from a file or files of your own, e.g., your own experimental results, fieldwork data etc.; you can create it from any publicly available data, e.g., [twitter data with sentiment](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/vineetdhanawat/twitter-sentiment-analysis/master/datasets/Sentiment%20Analysis%20Dataset%20100000.csv); you can create it from the results of parsing a novel or novels), explain the reasoning behind the architecture of your database | 
|  2   | create a dataframe/dataframes from your database, manipulate your dataframe creating new columns, applying functions, taking subsets etc. (at least 4 different manipulations) |   
| 2 | draw at least 4 plots/graphs from your dataframe, comment on the reasoning behind the visualization and on the results of it | 
| 1 | you get a point if you use morphological parsing at any stage (at the stage of the db creation or at the stage of working with a dataframe) |
| 1 | you get a point if you use syntactic parsing at any stage (at the stage of the db creation or at the stage of working with a dataframe) |
| +1 | you get an additional point if you do all of the above plus use something that we haven't discussed in class, e.g., interactive plots (if you do decide to draw interactive plots, keep in mind that they should be displayed properly) or statistical analysis |
| +1 | you get an additional point if you do all of the above plus your notebook reads like a short, but complete piece of research with internal logic, hypotheses, testing, results, comments and conclusions |
