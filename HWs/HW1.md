1. Choose a long text (a novel), do preprocessing on it (delete punctuation, lemmatize it) -- 2 points
2. Train a word2vec model on the chosen text, set the parameters (window size, vector size, number of iterations etc.), comment on your choice of parameter settings and the reasoning behind it -- 3 points (1 point for the model, 2 points for the comments)
3. Test your model, use `most_similar`, `similarity`, `doesnt_match` functions, comment on the model performance -- 3 points (1 point for the use of the functions, 2 points for the comments and reasoning behind the testing)
4. Visualize the results of the training and testing (one plot or one graph), comment on the visualization -- 2 points (1 point for the plot/graph, 1 point for the commentary)
