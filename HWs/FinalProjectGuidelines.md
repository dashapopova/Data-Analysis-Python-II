## Final Project Guidelines

**Due 28.10 23:59** Please e-mail me a link to the github repository with your work

This is the exam for this class (there won't be a separate exam meeting!), it is worth 40% of the final grade

Final project is a homework that you design for yourself. Ideally, your project should help you with your linguistic research outside of the course.

Some suggestions:

* a program that analyzes fieldwork data (db, dataframes, parsing, visualization)
* a program that downloads some data from the web, preprocesses it and visualizes it (requests, beautiful soup, API, db, dataframes, morphological parsing, syntactic parsing, tfidf, visualization)
* a program that draws graphs for a couple of different semantic fields in a couple of languages (morphological parsing, syntactic parsing, semantic vectors, clustering, visualization)

8 points -- your work reads as a mini-research paper with internal logic, hypotheses, comments, conclusions

9, 10 points -- your work reads as a mini-research paper with internal logic, hypotheses, comments, conclusions; the project idea is ambitious and shows enthusiasm for the project
